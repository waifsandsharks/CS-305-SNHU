CS-305-H7291 Software Security 21EW1
- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a financial instution looking to incorporate additional security into their already exsisting application.
- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  - I enjoyed testing potential vulnrabilities in my code via static testing. Secure coding is important to protect not only your property but the property of your users. Personal informaiton and trade secret loss can cause great harm to both people and businesses. Coding secure software helps to secure information and overall helps to protect a companys reputation in the long run. 
- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  - The dependency check tool was the most helpful, it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities Vs. checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities.
- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  - Through testing most of the vulnrabilities were casued by using old libraries so by updating the libraries currently in use in the code more secure software is created. Using  penetration testing in the future will better assess the and additional vulnerabilities within the code.
- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - Through coding the software I continually ran debugs to ensure that it was functional. After refactoring the code I ran another vulnrability test to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced. 
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - I used stackoverflow quite a bit and checked how peersw were solving like situaitons to mine, especially when running into errors in the console.
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
